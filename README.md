# RISC_V
Assignment Questions. Write a RISC-V Assembly program to
1. return your favorite number. Verify.
2. Print Hello World.
3. a. N_Sum: Calculate the sum of first N positive integers. Initiate an arbitrary N in the program.
b. Calculate the sum of first N positive integers. N is an input to the program.
4. Print the first N Fibonacci numbers.
5. print_int: Write a program to convert a 2 digit integer to its equivalent ASCII string. Create a print_int
procedure which takes the 2 digit decimal int as the input, and outputs the address of the ASCII
string.
6. Use the print_int procedure to print the sum from the N_sum program.
7. Find the GCD of two numbers. Both numbers are initiated by the programmer in the code.
8. multiply_proc: multiply two numbers using only RV64I instructions.
9. Use multiply_proc to print the factorial of a number.
10. add two arrays. All the data can be init in the program.
11. sort an array (use your favorite sort algo). Array can be init in the program.
12. Print the first N Fibonacci numbers using recursion.
13. binary search.
14. convert an infix expression to prefix and postfix.
